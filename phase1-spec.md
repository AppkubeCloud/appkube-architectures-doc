# Introduction
This document will detail about the aproach we take in phase1 to implement the basic SRE functionalities.
In Phase1 , we wanted to leverage the existing grafana functionalities and write the custom grafana functionalities to implement our features. In phase2 , we will gradually refactor the codebase and will write more independent modules.


please refer to the diagrams below for phase1 and phase2 architecture:
